# Notes:
# 1. Replace 'yolo-claudecode' with your desired hostname/container name
# 2. Adjust the port mapping (22222) if needed
# 3. Update the image name if using a different image
# 4. The workspace path uses ${HOME} which will be expanded from your environment
# 5. Use 'docker compose up -d' to start
# 6. Use 'docker compose down' to stop and remove
# 7. Use 'docker compose restart' to restart without recreating
